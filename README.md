# Byfron FAQ (Frequently asked questions)

## What is Byfron?

You might think that byfron is an anti-cheat, but this is not true. Byfron is the company that makes Hyperion, which is the anti-tamper (not anti-cheat) system. It has been released to the Web version, and on September 15, 2023, it was released to the UWP version.

## What is UWP?

Universal Windows Platform, or UWP, is the Microsoft Store's version of Roblox.

## I see people still exploiting, how is it possible?

As of now, Roblox hasn't made everyone switch to the new version with Hyperion. This means that people who didn't upgrade can still use executors, and people who did upgrade can go back to the previous version.
Since mobile and mac don't have Hyperion, people can still hack on them.

But I am going to mention that Roblox has announced that Hyperion will be coming to the mobile version.

## Is Hyperion bypassable?

Yeah. Hyperion was bypassed by electron but was detected by roblox after some time, but it showed that hyperion is definetely bypassable, co and cheatbuddy is working on electron and with cheatbuddy's sysguard I hope electron might be undetected for many months or until roblox doesn't switch to kernel.

## What executors to use?

None are updated and working, if you find any that claim to be working on PC they are 99% a virus.
You can still exploit on mobile and macos (please note that emualators may be detected, not sure)
