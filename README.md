# Byfron FAQ (Frequently asked questions)

## What is Byfron?

You might think that byfron is an anti-cheat, but this is not true. Byfron is the company that makes Hyperion, which is the anti-tamper (not anti-cheat) system. It has been released to the Web version, and on September 15, 2023, it was released to the UWP version.

## What is UWP?

Universal Windows Platform, or UWP, is the Microsoft Store's version of Roblox.

## I see people still exploiting, how is it possible?

As of now, Roblox hasn't made everyone switch to the new version with Hyperion. This means that people who didn't upgrade can still use executors, and people who did upgrade can go back to the previous version.
Since mobile and mac don't have Hyperion, people can still hack on them.

But I am going to mention that Roblox has announced that Hyperion will be coming to the mobile version.

## Is Hyperion bypassable?

Yeah. As of September 19, we know that Cheat Buddy has found a way to get around Hyperion that works for every game and will soon be releasing it. 3dsboys08 with Synapse V3 is the next person who will definitely get around Hyperion.
